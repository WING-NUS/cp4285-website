## Weekly Schedule

{{< week-card week="Week 1" date="11-17 Aug 2026" focus="Recommendation Problems and Classical Methods" >}}

Topics:

- Recommendation tasks
- Explicit vs implicit feedback
- Popularity-based recommendation
- Content-based recommendation
- Collaborative filtering

Ethics thread: popularity bias, exposure inequality, and platform incentives.

Learning outcomes:

- Formulate a recommendation task using a user-item matrix, available signals, and either a prediction or top-*k* ranking objective.
- Compare popularity-based, content-based, collaborative-filtering, and knowledge-based recommendation in terms of their evidence, suitable use cases, and limitations.
- Explain cold-start and sparse-data challenges, and justify an appropriate response.
- Compute and interpret user-user or item-item similarity using appropriate neighborhood-based collaborative-filtering measures.
- Explain how neighborhood selection, similarity weighting, and ranking objectives affect prediction quality, exposure, and long-tail visibility.
- Critique recommendation choices in terms of privacy, fairness, robustness, novelty, and stakeholder impact.
